==================

This repository is for final project which shows how my final project works accordingly with some mathematical convergence theorem of infinite series.
There are various test i will implement in this project such as P-Series Test, Divergence Test, Integral Test, Comparison Test, Limit Comparison Test, Ratio Test, and Root Test. Inputs are going to be equation of series and type of test the user want to test: GST, PST, DT, IT, CT, LTC, RT, and ROOT are the abbreviations for various tests. If given test is successful it will return True other wise False. True means that the infinite sum of the series is convergent, otherwise divergent.
